# Writing Kit

Writing kit is a template repository for creating documentation sites using
[squidfunk's mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) project. It includes a
hand-crafted [devcontainer](https://containers.dev) experience to make activities that are adjacent
to writing and publishing easier.

For software engineers, most important work entails writing professional, technical prose in
combination with diagrams, code snippets and other visual aids. This template project provides an
opinionated selection of tools and patterns that are useful for composing clear and efficient
documents.
